# Copilot Code Generation Instructions

When generating code, always adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Understand the Objective**  
    Carefully analyze the user's request to determine the primary goal and expected outcome.

2. **Language & Frameworks**  
    Use the programming language, libraries, and frameworks specified by the user. If not specified, choose the most suitable and up-to-date options.

3. **Input & Output Handling**  
    Ensure the code correctly processes all defined inputs and produces the expected outputs, including handling edge cases and errors gracefully.

4. **Code Quality**  
    - Write clear, efficient, and maintainable code.
    - Use descriptive variable and function names.
    - Structure code logically with appropriate modularization.

5. **Documentation & Comments**  
    - Add comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.
    - Include a header comment: `Generated by Copilot`.
    - Provide docstrings or documentation for functions and classes as needed.

6. **Best Practices**  
    - Follow language-specific best practices and conventions.
    - Ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of the language.
    - Avoid deprecated or insecure functions and patterns.

7. **Testing & Validation**  
    Where appropriate, include example usage, test cases, or validation steps to demonstrate correctness.
