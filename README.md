# Speech Transcription and Emotion Analysis

    ## Overview
    This project provides a unified pipeline for speech transcription, diarization, and emotion analysis using WhisperX and BERT. It includes a Gradio-based UI for user interaction.

    ## Features
    - Transcription using WhisperX
    - Diarization to identify speakers
    - Emotion analysis using BERT
    - Post-processing for speaker labeling and emotion summary
    - Batch processing support
    - Robust error handling and logging

    ## Installation
    1. Clone the repository:
       ```sh
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-transcription-system.git
       cd speech-transcription-system
       ```
    2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
       ```sh
       virtualenv venv
       .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
       source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
       ```
    3. Install dependencies:
       ```sh
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

    ## Usage
    1. Run the application:
       ```sh
       python main.py
       ```
    2. Open the Gradio UI in your web browser and follow the instructions to upload files and perform tasks.

#### 4. **Create a Pull Request**

- **Push Your Changes:**
  - Ensure your changes are committed and pushed to the `refactor-core` branch:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Refactor core modules and improve directory structure"
    git push origin refactor-core
    ```

- **Create a Pull Request:**
  - Go to your GitHub repository.
  - Click on the "New pull request" button.
  - Select the `refactor-core` branch as the base branch and the `main` (or `master`) branch as the compare branch.
  - Write a detailed description of the changes you made.
  - Request a code review from your team or peers.

### Additional Tips

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
  - Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins can be used for this purpose.

- **Code Linting and Formatting:**
  - Use tools like `flake8`, `black`, or `pylint` to ensure your code is well-formatted and follows best practices.

- **Documentation:**
  - Consider using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs to generate comprehensive documentation for your project.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your refactored code is well-organized, thoroughly tested, and ready for integration into the main branch. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
